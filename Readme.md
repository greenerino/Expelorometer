# Expelorometer - A simple experience tracking addon for Classic WoW - V. 0.2
I originally created this addon to get familiar with Lua and addon creation for Classic WoW. I figured a simple tool that grabs and displays data from gameplay would be a good introduction.

## Installation
If you wish to install this addon, simply download the source code (only need the .toc and .lua files), and put them in your addon folder (World of Warcraft\\_classic\_\Interface\AddOns) within a folder named `Expelorometer`.

## Known Issues and ToDos
* Currently only updates rates when exp comes in. Planning to have it update every x seconds, e.g. 5 seconds.
* Save rates upon logout
* Currently unsure if all experience sources are handled
